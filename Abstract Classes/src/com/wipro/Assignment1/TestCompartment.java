/*
 Create an abstract class Compartment to represent a rail coach. Provide an abstract function notice
in this class. public abstract String notice();
Derive FirstClass, Ladies, General, Luggage classes
from the compartment class. Override the notice function
in each of them to print notice message that is suitable
to the specific type of  compartment.
Create a class TestCompartment.Write main function to do the following:

Declare an array of Compartment of size 10.
Create a compartment of a type as decided by a randomly generated integer in the range 1 to 4.
Check the polymorphic behavior of the notice method.
[i.e based on the random  number genererated, the first
compartment can be Luggage, the second one could be Ladies and so on..]
